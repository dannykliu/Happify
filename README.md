# Nspire2016

This chrome extension replaces any depressing or disturbing images with a happy face of a kitten!

We used Clarifi API to retrieve a list of tags to describe an image, Pearson dictionary API to extract the definition of the tags, and Indico Sentiment Analysis API to determine whether an image is positive or negative.

Upon finding any negative images, we replace them with a happy one of kitten!!!
